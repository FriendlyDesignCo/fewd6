			<h2>Create Your Online Resumé</h2>
			<p class="lead">
			During the first two lessons, we will build a personal web page for Wendy G. Bite. Your assignment, this week, is to create your own online resume. Create an about me and resume page and style it with CSS. Remember you can always return to this assignment during the course to add styling and content. Don't forget to link the two pages together.

				<b>The goal for this assignment is to practice front-end web dev work flow (i.e working locally on your computer and practice html and css syntax).</b>
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			In addition to the assignment, there are also a set of exercises to help you practice <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/?test=html_basics">HTML</a> as well as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/?test=css_basics">URL's and CSS syntax</a>. They aren't graded, but they will help you practice the concepts learned in class, so it's in your best interest to attempt them.
